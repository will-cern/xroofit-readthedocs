The RooFit Browser
===================================

The ``xRooBrowser`` (``ROOT::Experimental::RooBrowser`` in ROOT 6.28+) is a powerful GUI to help you understand and analyse workspaces, in particular to understand the behaviour of the models in the workspaces. Models and datasets can be drawn and fit directly in the browser, and post-fit plots can be generated. The dependence of models on parameters can be explored. 

More documentation will follow on these pages as and when I have time to work on them ....
