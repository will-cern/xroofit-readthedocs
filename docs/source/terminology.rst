Terminology
===========

This section introduces the terminology convention adopted throughout the rest of this course. It also serves as a summary of the basic building blocks of statistical analysis.

What is statistical analysis?
-----------------------------

It can be many things, but I will offer the following description that will cover many of the common analyses performed in HEP:

.. admonition:: \ \ 
  Statistical analysis is the process of make inferences about the values of parameters from a dataset of observables, using a parameterized probability model for the dataset. 

Therefore we need to understand the following terms: parameters, observables, models, datasets. 

Variables
---------
A `variable` is simply something that has a value. They can be either `continuous` or `discrete`. Discrete variables may also called *categorical* variables. In a statistical analysis variables are either an `observable` or a `parameter`. There are two types of observable: `regular observables` and `global observables`. Parameters are in one of two possible states: they are either `floating` or `constant`. The former 

Variables are used to construct `models` and `datasets`.
